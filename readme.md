# The ULTIMATE Change

[Original site](http://www.4gmtx.com)
**Original Developer of the site:** I do not know, but they better hope I never know.

This is the **most messy change** attempt for a redesign template I have ever taken.
Messy HTML code structure, no schema, empty css style, and deprecated tags.
`<script>`  tags everywhere, without proper placement.

`@import` from CSS is deprecated. Use CDN instead (much better load time) !
Original developers of the site, you better get your shit straight.

AND NO OPTIMIZED IMAGE, a single logo costs around 300KB, while it can be around 40-80KB,
and possibly below 30KB. I have maximized it but still about 100KB with no quality loss.

Just open **index.html** and **replika.html** file.

Changelog:

- Mobile version header, fix padding top;
- Toggle menu on right, unless you have user specific;
- button page then move to left again;
- change logo margin, menu, etc;
- Typo changes;
- Empty styles removed;
- Mobile version fixes, **A LOT**, I do not bother to name one-by-one anymore.

### NOTES

NOBODY uses `<u><b>` anymore and put string inside `<ul>` but outside `<li>`.

Your footer code is a BLOODY mess, I do not bother to touch it after a few tweaks
(Very, VERY messy code structure, who puts `<h2>` inside `<ul>` but outside `<li>`).
